# Playroom for @kiwicom/orbit-components

Playroom allows you to design in the browser with [orbit-components](https://github.com/kiwicom/orbit-components/) and support of JSX. You can easily share your code with anyone through a link, or open an example from [orbit.kiwi](https://orbit.kiwi).

### Notes

- The autocomplete works only for component names for now.
- This repository will be eventually moved to Orbits monorepo.
